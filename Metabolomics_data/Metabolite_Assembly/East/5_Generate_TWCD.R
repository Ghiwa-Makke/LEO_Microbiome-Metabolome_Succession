#### Determining distances ####
# ########################### #

### Pairwise molecular distance between peaks
Mol.Info = as.data.frame(apply(Mol.Info, 2, scale), row.names = row.names(Mol.Info)) # Generating a distance matrix based upon the provided parameters
mol.dist = as.matrix(vegdist(Mol.Info, "euclidean", na.rm = TRUE))

### Determining transformation distance
# Creating the network
net = graph_from_data_frame(d=peak.2.peak, vertices=num.trans, directed=F)
rm("peak.2.peak", "num.trans")

# The distances command is much better than the similarity measurement
net.dist = distances(net)

# Finding clusters and determining the distance in the largest
clus = clusters(net)
max.clus = which(clus$csize %in% max(clus$csize)) # Finding the largest cluster
max.clus = names(clus$membership)[which(clus$membership %in% max.clus)] # Finding the members of the largest cluster

net.dist = net.dist[max.clus, max.clus] # Setting the net dist to that size only; only lost ~4000 peaks by doing this with the dereplicated HJ-Andrews set

# Need to normalize the dissimiarlity to 0-1
net.dist = (net.dist-min(net.dist))/(max(net.dist)-min(net.dist))

### Parsing down the data
q = which(row.names(net.dist) %in% row.names(mol.dist)) # Net dist is generate in the Merged_EdgeNode_Files script - I probably will incorporate it here (or something)
net.dist.data = net.dist[q, q] # Matching the network distance to the molecular information

q = which(row.names(mol.dist) %in% row.names(net.dist.data))
mol.dist.data = mol.dist[q, q] # Matching the molecular information to the network distance

# Weighting and tree generation
weighted.dist = mol.dist.data*net.dist.data # Weighting the tree
